GPSy
====

GPSy (pronounced like 'gypsy') is a project to develop a piece of software for a
hand-held GPS device based on the mbed microcontroller and other random parts
I happen to have collected. It is currently in the very early stages of design
and testing so there's not much to see here and it is unclear yet if this project
will grow into something flexible and useful to others. We shall see...

The code is designed to work with mbed's web IDE (shudder) and I'm presently
using a script to upload, compile and program in one step but it's quite
horrible. If you fancy giving me a few tips on getting this working offline
then I would appreciate it greatly!
